Anitha asked to make a kabbadi game points recorder, where that recorder should have operations like,
Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:
Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
"+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
"D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
"C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.
anitha's Machine need to return the sum of the points that player could get in all the rounds.

Input Description:
List of string of scores in each round

Output description:
the sum of the points that player could get in all the rounds

Sample Input:
10 3 C D +

Sample Output:
60

Explanation:
First round = 10 -> sum is 10
second round = 3 -> sum is 10+3=13
third round =C round 2's data was invalid -> Sum is 10
fourth round = D you will get 20 points (second round data removed) sum->20+10=30
fifth round = + (last rwo round's sum + sum) -> 10(third) + 20(fourth)=30 + 30(sum) =60

Sample Input:
2 4 3 C +

Sample Output:
12

Sample Input:
22 C 33 D 4

Sample Output:
103

Sample Input:
9 4 C D C

Sample Output:
9

Sample Input:
23 D 15 C +

Sample Output:
138
